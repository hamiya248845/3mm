Microservices
-------------
The term microservices portrays a software development style that has grown from contemporary trends to set up 
practices that are meant to increase the speed and efficiency of developing and managing software solutions 
at scale. Microservices is more about applying a certain number of principles and architectural patterns as 
architecture. Each microservice lives independently, but on the other hand, also all rely on each other. 
All microservices in a project get deployed in production at their own pace, on-premise on the cloud, 
independently, living side by side.

In this article, we will learn the concept of Microservices, their architecture, and how to create 
microservices in .NET and C#. You will also learn steps to build, deploy, and test microservices in .NET using 
a docker container.
